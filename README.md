Presently, there is an increasing fascination among researchers and academics with digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain. The stipulation

An efficient supply chain management solution is essential for attaining substantial advantages.

The benefits arising from the integration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) and blockchain technology. However, there

These technologies raise multiple concerns, one of which being sustainability.

A sustainable ecosystem characterised by several constraints, including temporal and energetic limits,

Analysis of the expenses and carbon dioxide (CO2) releases associated with supply chain management applications. Inside

This paper presents a blockchain-assisted solution that is both sustainable and safe.

The combination of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) and environmentally conscious supply chain systems has many limitations. Initially,

We present an enduring and reliable approach that guarantees a superior level of security.

Validates the precision of the ledger data obtained from the nodes inside the supply chain management system.

Inside the system. When it comes to conserving the natural environment, we give priority to

The issue can be characterised as a combinatorial problem involving multiple factors.

Constraints such as temporal, energetic, financial, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

To tackle this issue of employment in supply chain management, we

Present a specialised evolutionary approach that integrates many restrictions and is specifically tailored for deep convolutional networks.

The study used the MCGA-DCNN algorithm, a specific form of neural network, as its technique. The user's text is concise and unambiguous.

The objective is to minimise the total processing time.

Energy use, expenditure, and ecological footprint

Carbon dioxide (CO2) provides an advantageous atmosphere for the development and growth of supply chain management jobs.

The genetic algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm that employs a fitness function.

Modifies the weights of many constraints dynamically based on optimisation.

DCNN provides highly effective solutions for employment-related problems. Simulation and replication of a tangible process or system.

The results suggest that the use of MCGA-DCNN successfully decreased the duration, energy consumption, and expenses.

In addition, carbon dioxide (CO2) is thoroughly and consistently verified for every transaction that involves the whole supply chain.

An analysis of the differences between supply chain management vocations and existing systems.
